# Ideabox Group Project

Create, display, record and archive idea cards.

## Description
Have a really great idea but can't keep track of all of them in your brain?! Idea Box is an application to help you get your best ideas out of your head and into handy idea cards to reference later. 

**How it works**
- Create an idea card by filling out the title and body input.
- Click the save button to store your idea.
- Favorite your best ones, or delete your not-so-great ones.
- Filter through saved ideas, or view all at once!
